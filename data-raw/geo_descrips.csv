cd_-dr_,census division,"A census division is an area of regional government (such as a county or regional district) or an area treated as equivalent for statistical purposes. A census division is usually made up of a number of adjacent census subdivisions (municipalities). The file contains the boundaries of all census divisions, which combined, cover all of Canada."
ccs-sru,census consolidated subdivision,"A census consolidated subdivision is a grouping of adjacent census subdivisions (municipalities) used primarily for disseminating Census of Agriculture data. The file contains the boundaries of all census consolidated subdivisions, which combined, cover all of Canada."
csd-sdr,census subdivision,"A census subdivision is a municipality or an area treated as equivalent to a municipality for statistical purposes (for example, Indian reserves and unorganized territories). Municipal status is defined by laws in effect in each province and territory in Canada. The file contains the boundaries of all census subdivisions, which combined, cover all of Canada."
er_-re_,economic region,"An economic region is a grouping of complete census divisions (with an exception in Ontario) created as a standard geographic area for analysis of regional economic activity. The file contains the boundaries of all economic regions, which combined, cover all of Canada."
cma-rmr,census metropolitan area and census agglomeration,"Census metropolitan areas and census agglomerations consist of one or more adjacent municipalities (census subdivisions) around a core. To form a census metropolitan area, the core must have a population of at least 50,000 and the entire census metropolitan area must have a total population of at least 100,000. To form a census agglomeration, the core must have a population of at least 10,000. The file contains the boundaries of all census metropolitan areas and census agglomerations defined for the census. Census metropolitan areas and census agglomerations crossing provincial boundaries appear in the boundary file in provincial parts."
fed-cef,federal electoral district,"A federal electoral district is an area represented by a member of Parliament in the House of Commons. The federal electoral district boundaries used for the 2016 Census are based on the 2013 Representation Order. The file contains the boundaries of all federal electoral districts, which combined, cover all of Canada. The Federal Electoral District Boundary File portrays the federal electoral districts in effect on January 1, 2016."
ct_-sr_,census tract,"Census tracts are small, relatively stable geographic areas that usually have a population between 2,500 and 8,000. They are located in census metropolitan areas and in census agglomerations with a core population of 50,000 or more in the previous census. The file contains the boundaries of all census tracts located within the census metropolitan areas and census agglomerations for which census tracts are delineated."
dpl-ld_,designated place,"A designated place is normally a small community or settlement that does not meet the criteria established by Statistics Canada to be a census subdivision (municipality) or a population centre. Designated places are created by provinces and territories, in cooperation with Statistics Canada, to provide data for submunicipal areas. The file contains the boundaries of all designated places defined for the census."
pc_-cp_,population centre,"A population centre has a minimum population of 1,000 persons and a population density of at least 400 persons per square kilometre, based on the current census population count. The file contains the boundaries of all population centres defined for the census. Population centres crossing provincial boundaries appear in the boundary file in provincial parts."
ada-ada,aggregate dissemination area,"The aggregate dissemination area covers the entire country and, where possible, has a population between 5,000 and 15,000 based on the previous census population counts."
da_-ad_,dissemination area,"A dissemination area is a small area composed of one or more neighboring blocks. The file contains the boundaries of all dissemination areas, which combined, cover all of Canada."
db_-ib_,dissemination block,"A dissemination block is an area bounded on all sides by roads and/or boundaries of standard geographic areas. The file contains the boundaries of all dissemination blocks, which combined, cover all of Canada."
fsa-rta,census forward sortation area,"It depicts forward sortation area boundaries used for census dissemination, which are derived from postal codes obtained from census questionnaires. The census‑based forward sortation area boundaries are not necessarily equivalent to forward sortation area boundaries in use by Canada Post Corporation; they are representations created by aggregating dissemination blocks."
car-rar,census agricultural region,"A census agricultural region is formed with one or several adjacent census division(s), with the exception of Saskatchewan, where it is a grouping of adjacent census consolidated subdivisions. Census agricultural regions are used primarily for disseminating Census of Agriculture data. The file contains the boundaries of all census agricultural regions which, when combined, cover all provinces and territories of Canada."
ecu-eco,population ecumene census division cartographic,The Population Ecumene Census Division Cartographic Boundary File contains a generalised population ecumene based on census population density data with at least one ecumene polygon appearing within every census division. This file can be used to produce small‑scale thematic maps of statistical data.
-,agricultural ecumene census division cartographic,"The Agricultural Ecumene Census Division Cartographic Boundary File contains a generalised agricultural ecumene displaying areas of significant agricultural activity, with polygons split by census division. This file can be used to produce small‑scale thematic maps of agricultural statistical data."
rnf-fnr,road network file,"The 2016 Road Network File is a digital representation of Canada's national road network. It contains information such as street names, types, directions and address ranges. Streets are ranked according to five levels of detail, suitable for mapping at small to medium scales. User applications of this file may include mapping, geocoding, geographic searching, area delineation and database maintenance as a source for street names and locations. Since statistical activities do not require absolute positional accuracy, relative positional accuracy takes precedence in the Road Network File. As a result, this file is not suitable for engineering applications, emergency dispatching services, surveying or legal applications. The 2016 Census Road Network File is portrayed in Lambert projection. The Road Network File using latitude and longitude coordinates (North American Datum of 1983 [NAD83]) could be made available upon request."
