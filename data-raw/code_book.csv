geo_level,2,4,cma,census metropolitan area and census agglomeration,"Census metropolitan areas and census agglomerations consist of one or more adjacent municipalities (census subdivisions) around a core. To form a census metropolitan area, the core must have a population of at least 50,000 and the entire census metropolitan area must have a total population of at least 100,000. To form a census agglomeration, the core must have a population of at least 10,000. The file contains the boundaries of all census metropolitan areas and census agglomerations defined for the census. Census metropolitan areas and census agglomerations crossing provincial boundaries appear in the boundary file in provincial parts."

geo_level,2,4,-,agricultural ecumene census division cartographic,"The Agricultural Ecumene Census Division Cartographic Boundary File contains a generalised agricultural ecumene displaying areas of significant agricultural activity, with polygons split by census division. This file can be used to produce small‑scale thematic maps of agricultural statistical data."
geo_level,2,4,rnf,road network file,"The 2016 Road Network File is a digital representation of Canada's national road network. It contains information such as street names, types, directions and address ranges. Streets are ranked according to five levels of detail, suitable for mapping at small to medium scales. User applications of this file may include mapping, geocoding, geographic searching, area delineation and database maintenance as a source for street names and locations. Since statistical activities do not require absolute positional accuracy, relative positional accuracy takes precedence in the Road Network File. As a result, this file is not suitable for engineering applications, emergency dispatching services, surveying or legal applications. The 2016 Census Road Network File is portrayed in Lambert projection. The Road Network File using latitude and longitude coordinates (North American Datum of 1983 [NAD83]) could be made available upon request."
